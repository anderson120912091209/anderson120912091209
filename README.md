### 🚀 About Me
I’m **Anderson** — a gap-year wanderer, creative thinker, and bench-warmer turned software tinkerer.  
I fell in love with science through high school PubMed deep-dives, then jumped into **Chemical Engineering & Business** at **NTU** and **EPFL**.  
Currently on a **Gap Year** as **JGP Fellow #3** (Aug 2025 — Aug 2026), wandering between **Taipei**, **Singapore**, and **Beijing**.
